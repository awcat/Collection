# Collection


This script copies files from source to destination checking if files exist, if they are the same size or not and then then copying them only under certain conditions.. 
If a file exists, it copies only if larger.
If it does not exist, it copies over directly.
It is useful if you need to merge folders from different backups looking for the latest and best version of your files.
